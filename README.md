# Weather-Dashboard by Jakub Marchel 

I was tasked with the creating a weather dashboard that lets the user search by city and zip code. The current weather is displayed showing temperature, humidity, UV index, and descirption with an icon of current weather condtion (cloudy, rainy, foggy, etc.). 

The 5 day forecasest is also presented when the search is completed. 

The users' searches are saved to the local storage and can be clicked on to review at a later time. The user can choose to clear the search history by clicking the corresponding button. 

The user also has ability to also use the "Enter" button on the keyboard to run the search query while the "Delete" keyboard key will clear the current input text tab, allowing the user to perform another search without deleting a letter at a time. 

The deployed website can be found following the link below:
